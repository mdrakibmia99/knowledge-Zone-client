    "description": "We use redux for state management. It is a JavaScript library and using it makes the whole project very lightweight. With Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can get to any state that it needs from this store. Redux permits you to oversee your app's state in a single put and keep changes in your app more unsurprising and traceable. It makes it simpler to reason approximately changes happening in your venture. As the official authoritative library for Respond and Redux, Respond Redux includes a huge community of clients. This makes it less demanding to inquire for offer assistance, learn almost the best hones, utilize libraries that construct on the beat of Respond Redux, and reuse your information over diverse applications. On the off chance that execution may be a concern, the perfect way the most perfect way to progress execution is to skip superfluous re-renders so that components as they were re-render when their information has really changed. Respond Redux actualizes numerous execution optimizations inside, so that your own component as it were re-renders when it really has to. In expansion, by interfacing numerous components in your Respond component tree, you'll be able to guarantee that each associated component as it were extricates the particular pieces of information from the store state that are required by that component. This means that your possess component will have to be re-render less regularly since most of the time those particular pieces of information haven't changed. Redux makes a difference you bargain with the shared state administration, but like every apparatus, it has tradeoffs. There are more concepts to memorize, and more code to type in. It moreover includes a few indirections to your code and inquires you to take after certain confinements. It's a trade-off between brief-term and long-term efficiency."
